### Step 1 - Circular Consensus Sequence (CCS) calling
Each sequencing run is processed by `ccs` to generate one representative circular consensus sequence (CCS) for each ZMW. Only ZMWs with at least one full pass (at least one subread with SMRT adapter on both ends) are used for the subsequent analysis.
Polished CCS subreads were generated, using CCS v.6.4.0, from the subreads bam files witha minimum quality of 0.99 (default).
(See: [How does CCS work](https://ccs.how/how-does-ccs-work.html))
```bash
ccs -j <threads> 1.rawdata/m64083_230912_092706.subreads.bam 2.ccs/m64083_230912_092706.ccs.bam
```

### Step 2 - Primer removal
Removal of primers and identification of barcodes is performed using [*lima*](https://github.com/pacificbiosciences/barcoding), which can be installed with `conda install lima` and offers a specialized `--isoseq` mode.
Even in the case that your sample is not barcoded, primer removal is performed by *lima*.
If there are more than two sequences in your `primer.fasta` file or better said more than one pair of 5' and 3' primers, please use *lima* with `--peek-guess` to remove spurious false positive signal.
More information about how to name input primer(+barcode) sequences in this [FAQ](https://github.com/pacificbiosciences/barcoding#how-can-i-demultiplex-isoseq-data).

```bash
lima -j <threads> 2.ccs/m64083_230912_092706.ccs.bam ../../IsoSeqPrimers.fasta 3.primer_removal/output --isoseq
```

### Step 3 - Refine
Remove polyA and concatemers from FL reads and generate FLNC transcripts (FL to FLNC)
```bash
isoseq refine -j 104 3.primer_removal/output.primer_5p--primer_3p.bam ../../IsoSeqPrimers.fasta 4.refine/Regina_bud.flnc.bam --require-polya
```

### Step 4 - Clustering
Cluster FLNC reads and generate transcripts, much faster than "cluster" (FLNC to TRANSCRIPTS)
```bash
isoseq cluster2 4.refine/flnc.fofn 5.clustering/Regina_leaf_clustered.bam
```


 ### Step 5 - Mapping
```bash
pbmm2 index -j 104 --preset ISOSEQ final_markers.chr.fasta final_markers.chr.mmi
pbmm2 align -j 104 --sort --preset ISOSEQ final_markers.chr.mmi ../5.clustering/Regina_bud_clustered.bam Regina_bud_aln.bam
```

### Step 6 - Collapsing
After transcript sequences are mapped to a reference genome, isoseq collapse can be used to collapse redundant transcripts (based on exonic structures) into unique isoforms. Output consists of unique isoforms in GFF format and secondary files containing information about the number of reads supporting each unique isoform. [Source](https://isoseq.how/classification/isoseq-collapse.html)
```bash
isoseq collapse -j 104 --do-not-collapse-extra-5exons ../6.mapping/Regina_bud_aln.bam ../../4.refine/m64083_230912_092706.flnc.bam Regina_bud.gff
```
> Notes: The optional `<flnc.bam>` input is required to get the correct FLNC counts for bulk Iso-Seq in the `flnc_count.txt supplemental file. `collapse by default will collapse isoforms containing 5p degradation as of version 3.8.0. To turn this off `--do-not-collapse-extra-5exons` should be used. This option is recommended for bulk Iso-Seq.

- **Collapsing extra 5p exons**

For applications like single-cell Iso-Seq where there is a higher percentage of 5p truncated isoforms, it is useful to collapse isoforms that have a matching exon structure with the exception of extra 5p exons. Previous versions of collapse did not merge isoforms with extra 5p exons. As of v3.8.0, collapse will merge these isoforms by default. **To not allow merging isoforms with extra 5p exons**, use `--do-not-collapse-extra-5exons`. This option is used in the bulk Iso-Seq workflow.

- **Flexible first/last exon differences**

Previous versions of `collapse` used stringent maximum differences (5bp) for both internal junctions and external junctions. As of v3.8.0, the maximum 5p and 3p differences have been increased and paramaters added to allow adjustments. Note: the maximum 5p difference only applies when `--do-not-collapse-extra-5exons` is set.

Latest v4.0.0 `collapse` maximum junction difference parameters:
```
  --max-fuzzy-junction            INT    Ignore mismatches or indels shorter than or equal to N. [5]
  --max-5p-diff                   INT    Maximum allowed 5' difference if on same exon. [50]
  --max-3p-diff                   INT    Maximum allowed 3' difference if on same exon. [100]
```
